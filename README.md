# Robots-R-Us

## Description

You've just been hired at Robots-R-Us. Your first task is to build a social-media inspired employee directory using React with a backend API written in Rails. [Example data](src/data.json) is provided, and the designer gave you this spec to work off:

## Objective

* Build employee directory using reusable React components, _inspired_ by the spec above
* Build a database-backed API to return (optionally filtered) employee data
* Open a pull request against `main` with whatever you've completed to have your code reviewed

## Getting Started

### Fork this repo

Click on the Fork button in the top-right corner of this repo. This creates a new copy of `robots-r-us` under your GitHub user account with a URL like:
```
https://github.com/<YourUserName>/robots-r-us
```
The copy includes all the code, branches, and commits from the original repo.

Next, clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/robots-r-us
```
Once the repo is cloned, you need to do two things:

Create a new branch by issuing the command:
```
git checkout -b <your_name_and_branch_name>
```

Create a new remote for the upstream repo with the command:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bloomfire/robots-r-us
```
In this case, "upstream repo" refers to the original repo you created your fork from.

### Up & Running

* Install Node (>= 14.5) & Yarn (>= 1.17)
* Install Ruby (>= 3.0)
* Install Dependencies

```
$ cd robots-r-us
$ yarn
$ cd api
$ bundle
```

Get the server running

```
$ cd robots-r-us
$ yarn start
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## To-Do
* Render robot `data` on the page — include the robots' full names, email addresses, avatars, and job titles in their profiles
* Add a dynamic, clickable "Follow" button to each profile that distinguishes between followed and unfollowed robots
* Style the page to make it your own (background colors, layouts, cards vs list-items, etc)
* Build out the `/api/employees` API endpoint to return data in the same structure as [example data](src/data.json).  (Yes, it's supposed to be a little odd.  Sometimes life is that way ...)
* Make sure the API is fed by a database (e.g. SQLite3)
* Build in filtering to the API based on query parameter, e.g. `/api/employees?first_name=Red&last_name=Pudner`

#### Bonus points if you...
* Add responsive styling
* Use React Hooks
* Sort robots by last name (API and/or React)
* Add a default avatar for robots who don't have one
* Retain following state on refresh (API and/or React)

## Guidelines
* Please don't spend more than 1 or 2 hours on this challenge.  It's okay to not finish everything.  Do what you can as well as you can.
* This is a full-stack exercise, but if you can't do everything focus on the area that is your strongest.  If you are familiar with Rails but not React, consider starting there and think of React as a bonus.  If you are familiar with React but not Rails, then consider doing the opposite.
* Commit often, perfect later — commit your code as you go, even if it's not perfect (it will help us understand your process and train of thought). That being said, make sure your final product is code you're proud of
* Feel free to use libraries and plugins (lodash, styled-components, etc). We use them all the time
* Don't worry about automated tests. They're not required (but it won't hurt if you want to add some)

## Submit Your Code

Once you push the changes to your repo, the **Compare & pull request** button will appear in GitHub.

Open a pull request by clicking the **Create pull request** button. From here, we will review your code.
